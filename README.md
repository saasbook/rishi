## Customer's Business Need:

This app will serve as the homepage of Project Rishi's Berkeley chapter. The goal is to have the page showcase the work that has been done over the years in their deployment in India for the general public to see. They would also like an internal method that would allow Project Rishi members to update each other on their progress in preparation for their annual trip to india.
